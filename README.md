# minigames-discord-bot
A Discord bot for adding Minigames to servers.

So far, the bot can create channel categories and add channels to it, where minigames can be played. It can also create a "player" role.

Working on:
> Spectator role


> Mod role


> Minesweeper minigame

Once these are added I will work on the next features of the bot!
